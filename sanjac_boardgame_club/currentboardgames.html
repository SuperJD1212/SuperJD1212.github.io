                        <h2>Steampunk Rally</h2>
                        <p>
                            Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome. Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, 
                            players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical 
                            contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps.
                            Each round starts with a card draft in which players carefully select machine parts to add to their invention and one-shot boost cards to 
                            aid them or hinder opponents. Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they 
                            must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.
                            Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things 
                            like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts. Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player's 
                            damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention. These will need to be replaced in the draft 
                            phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies.

                        <h2>Steampunk Rally Fusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            Steampunk Rally Fusion is a standalone game that can be combined with the original Steampunk Rally. It introduces new tracks 
                            with unique event cards, new part abilities (Gear Up and Overcharge), and a new card type: Secret Projects. It also debuts new 
                            custom dice representing powerful Fusion energy!
                            Take on the role of ingenious inventors from history. Draft cards to invent your racing contraption. Power your creation's abilities 
                            with combinations of steam, heat, electricity, and Fusion dice. Use cogs to augment bad dice rolls and upgrade certain machine parts.
                            Smashing through damaging terrain spaces may cause parts to fly off your machine, constantly forcing you to adapt your strategy and 
                            discover new card synergies. Fortune favors the brash, so get ready to Gear Up, Overcharge your machine, and remake history!

                        <h2>The Chamelion</h2>
                        <p>
                            A bluffing deduction game for everyone.
                            Each round involves two missions, depending on whether you're the Chameleon or not.
                            Mission 1: You are the Chameleon. No one knows your identity except you. Your mission is to blend in, not get caught and to work out the Secret Word.
                            Mission 2: You are not the Chameleon. Try to work out who the Chameleon is without giving away the Secret Word.
                            At the beginning of the round each player receives a card that tells them if they are the Chameleon or hunting the Chameleon. 
                            Two dice are rolled and this gives everyone (except the Chameleon) the coordinates to a specific word on a Topic Card - this 
                            is the Secret Word for the round. Each Topic Card features 16 related words (e.g. countries, books, food, etc.)
                            Each player must now say a word relating to the Secret Word. The Chameleon can only make an educated guess based on the 16 words in front of them.

                        <h2>7 Wonders</h2>
                        <p>
                            You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, 
                            and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.
                            7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, 
                            then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting 
                            resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, 
                            and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process 
                            repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.
                            In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later 
                            in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others 
                            give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving 
                            and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an 
                            eye on the neighbors in both directions.
