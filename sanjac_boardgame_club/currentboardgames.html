                            Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome. Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, 
                            players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical 
                            contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps.
                            Each round starts with a card draft in which players carefully select machine parts to add to their invention and one-shot boost cards to 
                            aid them or hinder opponents. Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they 
                            must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.
                            Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things 
                            like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts. Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player's 
                            damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention. These will need to be replaced in the draft 
                            phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies.

                            A bluffing deduction game for everyone.
                            Each round involves two missions, depending on whether you're the Chameleon or not.
                            Mission 1: You are the Chameleon. No one knows your identity except you. Your mission is to blend in, not get caught and to work out the Secret Word.
                            Mission 2: You are not the Chameleon. Try to work out who the Chameleon is without giving away the Secret Word.
                            At the beginning of the round each player receives a card that tells them if they are the Chameleon or hunting the Chameleon. 
                            Two dice are rolled and this gives everyone (except the Chameleon) the coordinates to a specific word on a Topic Card - this 
                            is the Secret Word for the round. Each Topic Card features 16 related words (e.g. countries, books, food, etc.)
                            Each player must now say a word relating to the Secret Word. The Chameleon can only make an educated guess based on the 16 words in front of them.

                            You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, 
                            and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.
                            7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, 
                            then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting 
                            resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, 
                            and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process 
                            repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.
                            In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later 
                            in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others 
                            give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving 
                            and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an 
                            eye on the neighbors in both directions.

                            <b>THE GREAT RETURN</b></br>
                            Over generations and generations the ancient woodland of Børe prospered and grew. The world was bestowed with great spirit, which 
                            lifted the animals of the land to new heights. Unfortunately, over the years these clans lost touch with the spirit of the land and 
                            faction warring developed. The Foxen Kingdom of Skulk Hollow in the South, The spiritual Red Pandas of Cupboard in the North, the Mischievous
                             Mice of Multon in the West, and the colony of Blackheart Bunnies in the East. As skirmishes started breaking out across the continent, lives 
                             lost, there was a monstrous shake and then The Great Return. No one quite knows why, but the Guardians have risen - but not the kind, life-giving 
                             Guardians of spiritual legend. Dark, ferocious, versions that are now attacking all the kingdoms of the land.
                            </br><b>OBJECTIVE</b></br>
                            In Skulk Hollow, two players take the roles of either a towering behemoth of a Guardian trying to eliminate the clans of foxes who have been
                             causing havoc on the countryside, or a band of foxen heroes out to vanquish the evil beast that has been terrorizing the land and reunite the
                             four kingdoms of Børe.
                            The Guardian wins the game by either eliminating the Foxen King, or by gaining enough Tribute.
                            The Foxen Heroes wins the game by eliminating the Guardian.

                            Amsterdam, present day. A crime has been committed, but the police investigation is going nowhere. An anonymous client has called your detective 
                            agency to investigate. However, your rivals are on the case as well, so there's no time to waste.
                            Your Intelligence Officer will guide your Detectives through the city, by sending pictures to communicate. Each image contains location intel ... 
                            for those who can understand. But you need to decode the messages faster than your rivals while avoiding the police! Explore the city to find three 
                            pieces of evidence, and deliver them to your client before the other team in order to receive payment — and win the game!
                            The police don't want you on the case, so you'd best stay out of their way! If they spot you sniffing around, they'll put you behind bars, giving 
                            your rivals an easy victory.
                            Shadows - Amsterdam is a real-time simultaneous competition between detective agencies, using pictures that contain intel to communicate within your
                             own team. Player roles are asymmetrical: each Intelligence Officer tries to guide their own team around the board, and the Detectives try to 
                             understand their Intelligence Officer's clues in a fast-paced race to victory.

                            "You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, 
                            you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In 
                            all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring
                             civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.
                            But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed 
                            land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the 
                            coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted." 
                            </br>—description from the back of the box</br></br>

                            In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the 
                            players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the 
                            players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.
                            Dominion is not a Collectible Card Game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.

                            In Quacks, which was first released as The Quacks of Quedlinburg, players are charlatans — or quack doctors — each making their own secret 
                            brew by adding ingredients one at a time. Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!
                            Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their 
                            pots. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the pot's swirling pattern, increasing how much the potion will 
                            be worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot will explode!
                            At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients, depending on how well they managed to fill up 
                            their pots. But players whose pots have exploded must choose points or coins — not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of 
                            nine rounds wins the game.

                            Carcassonne is a tile placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape represented on it.   
                            The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have 
                            already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then 
                            decide to place one of their meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, 
                            or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.
                            During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: "Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?" or "Should I use this
                            tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?" Since
                            players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and 
                            possibilities.

                            In the quiet village of Ravenswood Bluff, a demon walks amongst you. During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, 
                            there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled 
                            on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised
                             in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the 
                             Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in 
                             time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?
                            Blood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game with players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who 
                            conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they
                             outnumber the townfolk.
                            During a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's
                             execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. During a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time
                              by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.
                            The Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. 
                            Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts 
                            trying to win from beyond the grave. If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it's started as a powerful Traveller character
                             with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game 
                             are ever the same character.

                            Inspired by a love of classic video games, Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game pits 2-4 players in a competition to build 
                            the ultimate side-scrolling dungeon. Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to 
                            see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls,
                             which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated — but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.
                            Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, 
                            and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure 
                            value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.
                            Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms 
                            are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every "build phase" is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed 
                            effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.

                            You're part of a team of brilliant scientists working on the super secret lab: CERN. While experimenting with teletransportation your team 
                            came across a wonderful discovery: portals to new dimensions!
                            Just imagine! Once a portal is open a whole new magical dimension is suddenly very close. All you need to do is take one step 
                            forward and you're there.
                            The problem is... The crazy wild creatures from those other dimensions can now walk in.
                            Oh no.
                            Close the portals NOW!
                            Multiuniversum is a card game puzzle in which players use actions on their cards to do research, move between 5 modules of 
                            the Hadron Collider, preparing tools so they can close portals to alternative realities.
