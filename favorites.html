				<p>
					My favorite Games are Borderlands 3, Assassins Creed Odessey, Rainbow six Siege, and Island of Insight. 
					Its a wierd set of games that somewhat relate to eachother. I enjoy Borderlands 3, Island Of Insight, and 
					Assassins Creed Odessy for the Open world aspect, being able to choose fom a miriad of things. I enjoy R6 
					for the tactical side of shooters, where as Boderlands 3 is more of a Arcade style shooter.

				<p>
					My favorite movies have somwhat of a Action / Story Theme to them. Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, 
					in my opinion, was the best out of all that has been made. It has some of the most iconic scenes while having alot 
					of storyline and plot mixed in. Jumanji was a good movie for its unique idea of getting trapped inside of a game 
					with some iconic actor including the Rock and Kevin Hart. Spiderman No Way Home was good, for it brought Actors 
					from the prevois spiderman movies as if they where from the multiverse.

				<h2 id="favorite-music">Favorite Music</h2>
				<p>
					My favorite songs are a mix of slow rock, to some Metal. Rob zombie - Dragula, has a good base thats good to headbang to. <br/>
					Feed the machine is a bit slower,but still has that solid rhythm. Finaly Necromanancin Dancin has that high energy.
